# Sudoku-Solver
The Sudoku Solver attempts to solve a sudoku problem by taking a csv file as the first command line input, which represents the traditional 9x9 sudoku board. Examples of CSV files are in the Examples subfolder. A simple run:

```
python main.py ./Examples/UnsolvedBoardDefinite.csv
```

## Pre-requisites
A python 3.7 interpreter and the numpy package installed.
